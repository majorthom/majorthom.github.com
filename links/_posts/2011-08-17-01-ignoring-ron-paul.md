# [Ignoring Ron Paul][dailyshow]

I always thought of Ron Paul as the progenitor of the Tea Party. Although he's crazy (a doctor who doesn't believe in evolution), I always thought he did make valid points. However, if I had to vote for a Republican, I'd say we could do worse than another [President Johnson][garyjohnson].
