> 	Taken as a group, it feels like a remarkably solid case — Samsung can’t just up and countersue Apple with its own patents and hope to walk away with a handshake and a cross-license because of the various trademark, trade dress, and design patent claims. How the company decides to deal with those issues remains to be seen; there’s no question in my mind that Samsung designed TouchWiz to look and feel as much like iOS as possible, and then marketed it as such.

This is a pretty straightforward, dumbed down analysis of Apple's claims against Samsung. Doesn't seem to be much of an argument against most of it—of course, that's why I'm not a lawyer.
