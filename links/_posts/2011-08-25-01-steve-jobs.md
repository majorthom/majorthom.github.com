# [Letter from Steve Jobs][apple] #

>   To the Apple Board of Directors and the Apple Community:

>   I have always said if there ever came a day when I could no longer meet my duties and expectations as Apple’s CEO, I would be the first to let you know. Unfortunately, that day has come.

>   I hereby resign as CEO of Apple. I would like to serve, if the Board sees fit, as Chairman of the Board, director and Apple employee.

>   As far as my successor goes, I strongly recommend that we execute our succession plan and name Tim Cook as CEO of Apple.

>   I believe Apple’s brightest and most innovative days are ahead of it. And I look forward to watching and contributing to its success in a new role. 

>   I have made some of the best friends of my life at Apple, and I thank you all for the many years of being able to work alongside you.

>   Steve
