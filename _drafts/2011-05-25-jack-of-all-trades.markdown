##   Jack of all trades

I'm sure you've heard the phrase "a jack of all trades" meaning a person talented in many areas. Often added, or forgotten depending on how you look at it, is "master of none."

This has given me much strife, especially in recent years as I've tried to discover what I want in life. The oft repeated advice is to find a specialty or a niche and focus on it. 

I have at various times attempted: web design, web developer, graphic design, photographer, writer. And these are just broad categories; graphic designer, for instance, can be broken into many smaller niches, such as logo designer, print designer, etc. 

The problem arises in that not only do I feel capable in all those and other fields, but that I enjoy them too. Sure, I may not be able to design a brochure as well as I can a logo or website, but does that mean I should never attempt it?

I haven't ever really wanted to start a podcast, but I hear a variation on his theme repeated as advise for those who want to. "Find what makes you different and sets you apart; find what unique offerings you have that no one else does."
