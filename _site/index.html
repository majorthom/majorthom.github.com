<blockquote><p>  To the Apple Board of Directors and the Apple Community:</p>

<p>  I have always said if there ever came a day when I could no longer meet my duties and expectations as Apple’s CEO, I would be the first to let you know. Unfortunately, that day has come.</p>

<p>  I hereby resign as CEO of Apple. I would like to serve, if the Board sees fit, as Chairman of the Board, director and Apple employee.</p>

<p>  As far as my successor goes, I strongly recommend that we execute our succession plan and name Tim Cook as CEO of Apple.</p>

<p>  I believe Apple’s brightest and most innovative days are ahead of it. And I look forward to watching and contributing to its success in a new role.</p>

<p>  I have made some of the best friends of my life at Apple, and I thank you all for the many years of being able to work alongside you.</p>

<p>  Steve</p></blockquote>

<p>I'm not the most versed when it comes to patents and am sure in theory they're well and good, but don't understand them at all in practice. His argument makes a lot of sense.</p>

<blockquote><p>  Taken as a group, it feels like a remarkably solid case — Samsung can’t just up and countersue Apple with its own patents and hope to walk away with a handshake and a cross-license because of the various trademark, trade dress, and design patent claims. How the company decides to deal with those issues remains to be seen; there’s no question in my mind that Samsung designed TouchWiz to look and feel as much like iOS as possible, and then marketed it as such.</p></blockquote>

<p>This is a pretty straightforward, dumbed down analysis of Apple's claims against Samsung. Doesn't seem to be much of an argument against most of it—of course, that's why I'm not a lawyer.</p>
